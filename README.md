# Wallpaper-downloading-script-for-linux-users
Tired of browsing the web and downloading wallpapers from a website, if so then you are at the right place, just run this simple bash script on your terminal and get your required category wallpapers on your pc in just one shot.

How to use..??
Using this script is as simple as running ls or cat command on your terminal.
Just run the script, select the category that will be displayed that you want to download, and here we go, the wallpapers will be on your PC. Real laziness.. :P
Ok so what are you waiting for, just go and start downloading..  :-)
And ya, don't forget to add proxy in case you need it.

Dedicated to all the (wallpapers && linux ) lovers..;-)
Enjoy and have a large collection without any effort. :D
